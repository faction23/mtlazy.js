# MTLazy.js

A small, fast, modern, and dependency-free library for lazy loading. This is a fork of Layzr.js bringing in ie9 support and some other features we needed for service projects at MT. 

Features in MTLazy not in Lazyr:

1. IE9 support.
2. Mobile image support allowing for an additional image targeting mobiles at a configurable breakpoint.
3. CSS fadein support and configurable duration.
4. Some additional config options listed below

## Usage

Follow these steps:

1. [Install](https://github.com/faction23/mtlazy.js#install)
2. [Image Setup](https://github.com/faction23/mtlazy.js#image-setup)
3. [Instance Creation](https://github.com/faction23/mtlazy.js#instance-creation)

### Install

Load the script.

[Download it](https://github.com/faction23/mtlazy.js/archive/master.zip), install it with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mtlazy), or install it with [Bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=mtlazy.js).

```html
<script src="mtlazy.js"></script>
```

### Image Setup

For each `img` and/or `iframe` you want to lazy load, put the `src` in the `data-src` attribute, and the class "lazyload".

```html
<img class="lazyload" data-src="image/source">
<iframe data-src="media/source"></iframe>
```

This is the only _required_ attribute. Advanced, _optional_ configuration follows:

#### (Optional) Placeholders

Include a placeholder, via the `src` attribute.

Images without a placeholder - _before_ they're loaded - may impact layout (no width/height), or appear broken.

```html
<img src="optional/placeholder" data-src="image/source">
```

#### (Optional) Retina Support

Include a retina (high-resolution) version of the image in the `data-retina-src` attribute. This source will only be loaded if the [devicePixelRatio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio) is greater than 1.

Ensure the proper CSS is in place to display both regular and retina images correctly. This library handles the loading, but not the displaying, of elements.

```html
<img data-src="image/source" data-retina-src="optional/retina/source">
```

#### (Optional) Mobile Image support

Include a mobile version of the image in the `data-mobile-src` attribute. This source will only be loaded if the window.innerWidth is less than the mobile threshold, which defaults to 768 but is configurable.

```html
<img data-src="image/source" data-mobile-src="optional/mobile/source">
```

#### (Optional) Background Images

Include the `data-bg-src` attribute to load the source as a background image.

The `data-bg-src` attribute should be valueless - the image source is still taken from the `data-src` and `data-retina-src` attributes.

```html
<div data-src="image/source" data-bg-src>
```

#### (Optional) Hidden Images

Include the `data-hidden-src` attribute to prevent an image from loading.

Removing this attribute _will not load the image_ - the user will still need to scroll, and the element will still need to be in the viewport.

```html
<img data-src="image/source" data-hidden-src>
```

### Instance Creation

Create a new instance, and that's it!

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy();
```

Documentation for all options follows:

## All Options

Defaults shown below:

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  container: null, // can be any container, defaults to document
  fade: false, // use css fadein?
  duration: 300, // fadein duration
  selector: '.lazyload', // customize the css selector mtlazy operates on
  attr: 'data-src', // the regular/only image
  retinaAttr: 'data-retina-src', // the optional retina variant attribute name
  mobileAttr: 'data-mobile-src', // the optional mobilevariant attribute name
  bgAttr: 'data-bg-src', // attr that triggers bg image lazyloading
  hiddenAttr: 'data-hidden-src', // stay hidden?
  threshold: 0, // viewport threshold
  clean: false, // cleanup attributes after load?
  breakpoint: 768,
  callback: null
});
```

Explanation of each follows:

### container

Customize the container that holds the elements to lazy load - using CSS selector syntax. This option may be useful when building single page applications.

Note that `window` is assumed to be the container if this option is set to `null`.

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  container: null
});
```

### fade

Should we fade in the image?

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  fade: true
});
```

### fade

If fade is true, what duration? Defaults to 300ms.

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  fade: true,
  duration: 600
});
```

### selector

Customize the selector used to find elements to lazy load - using CSS selector syntax.

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  selector: '.lazyload'
});
```

### attr / retinaAttr

Customize the data attributes that image sources are taken from.

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  attr: 'data-src',
  retinaAttr: 'data-retina-src',
  mobileAttr: 'data-mobile-src'
});
```

### bgAttr

Customize the data attribute that loads images as a background.

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  bgAttr: 'data-bg-src'
});
```

### hiddenAttr

Customize the data attribute that prevents images from loading.

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  hiddenAttr: 'data-hidden-src'
});
```

### threshold

Adjust when images load, relative to the viewport. Positive values make elements load _sooner_.

Threshold is a percentage of the viewport height - think of it as similar to the CSS `vh` unit.

```javascript
// load images when they're half the viewport height away from the bottom of the viewport

var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  threshold: 50
});
```

### clean

If clean is true, clean up attributes after image has loaded

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  clean: false
});
```

### breakpoint

If supplying a mobile image, at what breakpoint should it use?

```javascript
var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  breakpoint:768
});
```

### callback

Invoke a callback function each time an image is loaded.

The image _may not be fully loaded before the function is called_. Detecting image load is inconsistent at best in modern browsers.

```javascript
// in the callback function, "this" refers to the image node

var mtlazy = new Mtlazy({
  callback: function() {
    this.classList.add('class');
  }
});
```

## Browser Support

Mtlazy natively supports **IE9+**.
