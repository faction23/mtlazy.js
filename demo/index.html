        <h1>MTLazy Demo</h1>
        <p>This is a demo of mtlazy image lazyloading with retina support. IE9 and up. Based on lazyr.js.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>A small, fast, modern, and dependency-free library for lazy loading. This is a fork of Layzr.js bringing in ie9 support and some other features we needed for service projects at MT.</p>
        <p>Lazy loading boosts page speed by deferring the loading of images until they're in (or near) the viewport.</p>

        <h2>Some Spacey Filler</h2>
        <p>We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.</p>

        <p>It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.</p>

        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

        <p>We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.</p>

        <p>Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p>

        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
